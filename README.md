## Approach

As a developer relatively new to **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI**, I wanted to challenge myself to step beyond my previous experience with **Reactstrap** and **Bootstrap**. While those technologies are reliable, they aren't as modern or flexible as the ones I decided to explore for this project.

When I first viewed the page I had to redesign, I quickly realized that achieving a similar design with **Reactstrap** and **Bootstrap** would not have been ideal for achieving a modern, visually appealing design. So, I decided to take on an additional challenge of recreating the page using **Tailwind CSS** and **Material UI**.

During the setup, I encountered some challenges with **Tailwind** version 4. After multiple searches and troubleshooting, I concluded that **Tailwind** version 3 was a more stable and better option. This allowed me to keep the codebase clean, responsive, and easier to maintain.

Throughout the process, I focused on keeping the design functional, intuitive, and responsive across both mobile and desktop environments, using a mix of Tailwind's utility classes for styling and Material UI components for pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI elements.
